# Large Language Model for Graph Representation Learning (LLM4Graph)

## Motivation
Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized lots of areas and is now making its way into conventional graph representation learning. Some empirical evidence already shows that, with the powerful LLM, graph neural network doesn't seem to be irreplaceable and this trend is inevitable and unstoppable. So we will try to embrace it and keep track of its development. In this repository, we collect papers focusing on **LLM for graph learning tasks at node, edge and graph levels**. If you find that we miss any related work or we need to update information (publication, code, blog, etc. ) of the following papers, feel free to let us know by email (sitao.luan@mail.mcgill.ca, luansito@mila.quebec, jiaqi.zhu@mail.mcgill.ca).
